Helper functions to convert positive numbers to letters. 

Currently supported are English (US), Spanish and German.

The project uses ES6 export/import syntax, so you need to install also `esm`, `reify` or alike until if you use the package with Node.js.

Install with `npm install --save @softwarerero/numbertoword`.

Usage:

```
import numberToWord from '../numberToWord.en.js'

numberToWord(1) // should return 'one'
```
